Salient Region Detection and Segmentation for Python Using CImg
======================================================

This is a platform independent (not tested in Windows) version of Salient Region Detection and Segmentation technique represented in:

[R. Achanta, S. Hemami, F. Estrada and S. SÃ¼sstrunk, Frequency-tuned Salient Region Detection, IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2009), pp. 1597 - 1604, 2009.](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/135217/files/1708.pdf)

Check also the [webpage](http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/index.html) for the paper. 
Most of the code is unaltered from the [C++ sources](http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/SourceCode/SalientRegionDetectorAndSegmenter.zip) given on the webpage. 

The differences are: 
* Use of [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/) to handle picture loading and saving for platform independence
* Changed the code to work as a command line tool
* Added `ctypes` Python wrapper for main functionality

Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------
* [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/): For loading and saving pictures.
* [boost](http://www.boost.org/): Used for filepath manipulation. In case you don't want to use boost, you can alter the source of `CImgHandler::SavePictures`
* Image libraries: Defaults are [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) and [libjpeg](http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/). Check CImg documentation for full list of supported formats.

*The conversion has been done with minimum amount of work so any input and/or change suggestions are welcome.*

Usage
------------------------------------------------------

1. As Command line tool:

	1.1 Compile program with `make` (and `make clean`)

	1.2 Call the program created:

	`$>./saliency [-s] [-o=path/to/outfolder/] path/to/pic1 path/to/pic2 path/to/pic3 ...`

	where optional '-s' argument tells the program to not only do saliency mapping, but also mean shift based processing and extracting the most salient objects from the pictures.
	
2. From Python:

	2.1 Compile program as shared library with `make shared_osx` or `make shared_linux` (and `make clean`)
	
	2.2 Instantiate `SDRWrapper` object in Python and call it:
	
		from sdrWrapper import SDRWrapper
		sdrw = SDRWrapper()
		doSegmentation = True
		sdrw.saliency("path/to/outfolder", "path/to/my/pic", doSegmentation)
