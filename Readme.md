Salient Region Detection and Segmentation using CImg
======================================================

This is a platform independent version of Salient Region Detection and Segmentation technique represented in:

[R. Achanta, S. Hemami, F. Estrada and S. SÃ¼sstrunk, Frequency-tuned Salient Region Detection, IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2009), pp. 1597 - 1604, 2009.](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/135217/files/1708.pdf)

Check also he [webpage](http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/index.html) for the paper. 
Nearly all of the code is borrowed from [C++ sources](http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_CVPR09/SourceCode/SalientRegionDetectorAndSegmenter.zip) given on the webpage. 
The only difference is the use of [CImg](http://cimg.sourceforge.net/) (for platform independence) and changing it to a command line tool.
